LineLock – Guided Reading

LineLock helps you slow down and read with intention.

Instead of skimming or rereading passages, LineLock guides your eyes through text one word at a time—making it easier to stay focused, absorb meaning, and reduce mental fatigue.

How it works

1. Highlight any text on a webpage

2. Press Enter

3. LineLock reveals each word at a controlled pace while gently masking the rest

You stay in control the entire time.
